								<h2>Our Story</h2>
								<p>We started out with the goal of creating a machine that would produce wires ready for the breadboard. As a team we sought to create a highly finished and integrated project with a focus on precision. After the first sprint we decided to pivot from the previous idea to a CNC wire bender because our team consisted of members with a focus on areas other than mechanical engineering and felt that we lacked the expertise and knowledge to build something cool by the end of the semester that had too many mechanical systems. 

								Our team structured the project work to best facilitate our individual learning goals from the project. These learning goals included: improving mechanical design, 3-D fabrication, working with stepper motors, developing firmware and software, facilitating team dynamics, and designing electrical and mechanical systems for integration. 

								By the end of the project we had gone through multiple iterations of our idea, with each iteration improving on the previous by refining a component to be more finished or precise and adding more complexity to our product. In addition we had all reached our learning goals and learned through the work had done over the 4 sprints. An important lesson we all learned was the necessity to test integration early and often and scaling the project work to allow for sufficient time to test the integrated product.</p>
